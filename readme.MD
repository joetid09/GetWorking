GetWorking

Keeping track of applications and job postings from multiple sources can be difficult! GetWorking is an app that allows users to utilize simple forms to track where and how they applied, add contacts and networking info, additional details, keep track of when you applied, and even provide reminders to follow up on applications!

MVP Definition
Login page which will ensure user only sees their application when using app
Landing page with options to create or view current applications
Adding application page will be a form with boilerplate information that represents the application Model in Database
“View All” applications will list all the user’s applications. Clicking on the title will bring you to a details page
Have the ability to create events for each application, which will be a log of the users progress
Events will display a title, date it was created, date to complete, a body for description of event, and a checkbox that will update status once user clicks “completed”

Stretch Goals
Search bar on “View all” so users can find specific job titles
Ability for user to create custom tags, that can be used to sort and filter applications in “view all”
Setup timed reminders to be sent to user based on an events completion date
Setup a calendar scheduler for easy display and organization of events
Uploading resumes to applications so users can see what resume they submitted to the job posting

User Stories
As someone applying on multiple job posting platforms, I need a website or application that allows me to keep track of it all and be accessible to me on any device
Scrolling through a spreadsheet can be difficult as it all blends in, I need a much more accessible display for all my information
I’ve made contacts in all of these companies, I’d like an easier way to add multiple contacts to one application so I can follow up directly
